Claude, can you help me to execute this TODO list of things to ensure that my infrastructure for this compiler project to be up and running? Make plans for each 3 tasks outlined above in the TODO list. So far I'm enforcing some commit messages that I have, having a PR template and a CI/CD pipeline. are there also any other software engineering practices I am missing? if so tell me and we can brainstorm together. Note that this is very early stages of the project, so just make sure we prioritise having an "MVP" for the infra of the project first before doing anything too fancy. Thanks in advance chat!
